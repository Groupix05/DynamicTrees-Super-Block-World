# DynamicTrees-Template
 A template for DynamicTrees addons for 1.20.1 Forge & Sinytra Connector

# How to use
This template doesnt have any example for species or other. Check other addons and the wiki to know how to add them.
With this template, you can add your trees and resources, and the mod you want in build.gradle.kts and everything should work.

This template should be used with my comming GUI.

If you want to use it manualy, replace every "template" with the mod you want to create an addon for. Replace AuthorName with your name.
